# 🌐 mhserrao – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, built to showcase my work as a Full Stack Developer. My goal was to create a space that reflects both my technical skills and personal values - a clean, interactive, and responsive site where I can share projects, current learning, and aspirations.

I built this portfolio using a modern frontend stack, with attention to smooth UI/UX, scalability, and maintainability. As I continue to grow, this portfolio will evolve alongside me.

## 🧱 Design Philosophy

This portfolio reflects:

- **Minimalist, distraction-free layout** with soft animations and gentle spacing
- **A focus on real projects** over volume or filler
- **Scalability** – each component is modular and reusable for future additions
- **Accessibility** and mobile responsiveness built-in from the start

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This site was originally based on a React + Tailwind template by [Shaq](https://github.com/shaqdeff/Portfolio-Template), and has been fully customized by mhserrao. Shaq’s minimalist design provided a strong foundation to build upon with my own personality and project showcase.
